The ability to model the printing process within design software, to simulate strength, compliance, fits, etc. is lacking.
Also, the usability of current software is limited, but getting better.
The tool chain beyond design is also crap - with a few exceptions - since everyone is trying to solve only one piece of the workflow.
This has led to a dearth of designs (other than me too iPhone cases), and a convoluted and error prone printing process akin to the early days of desktop publishing with inferior application capability, myriad printer drivers, and subtle hardware problems.","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","No","closed loop control systems on printer control"

As far as home 3d printers the items that can be produced are mainly plastic (or pla which degrades) and for mass adoption other materials will have to be available. For 3d printing services there are other material options but the cost can be prohibitive for buyers that want to support your work and who don\'t want to buy something that looks like plastic. I think if people start to see more options in 3d printing more money will be put into it which can push a lot of projects forward.","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","No","Yes","Yes",""
